The `MentionInput` component is an accessible, customizable input field designed for chat, comment, and editor interfaces where users need to mention others or reference entities quickly and intuitively. It supports a flexible trigger (default `@`, but can be any character or string), customizable mention options, and advanced slot-based customization for internal elements.

**Main Features:**

- Type a trigger (default: `@`, customizable via the `trigger` prop) to open a mention dropdown with selectable options
- Keyboard and mouse navigation for fast, accessible selection
- Customizable mention options via the `options` prop
- Flexible callbacks, including `onChange` for input value changes
- Option to keep or remove the trigger character on selection (`keepTriggerOnSelect`)
- Slot-based customization for container, input, listbox, options, and more via `slotsProps`
- Fully accessible with ARIA roles and keyboard support
- Easy integration and styling for a variety of use cases
