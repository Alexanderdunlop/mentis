The `MentionInput` component is an accessible, customizable mention input solution designed for chat, comment, and editor interfaces where users need to mention others or reference entities quickly and intuitively. Built on a modern contentEditable architecture, it provides rich text capabilities with enhanced mention handling and DOM manipulation.

**Main Features:**

- **ContentEditable Architecture**: Modern implementation using contentEditable for rich text support and enhanced cursor navigation
- **Smart Mention Detection**: DOM-aware mention detection that distinguishes between mentions inside chips versus regular text
- **Flexible Trigger System**: Customizable trigger character or string (default `@`) via the `trigger` prop
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Full keyboard navigation including arrow key navigation into mention chips
- **Robust Text Handling**: Advanced mention insertion and parsing with comprehensive clipboard support
- **Customizable Display**: Option to keep or remove the trigger character on selection (`keepTriggerOnSelect`)
- **Slot-based Customization**: Comprehensive customization for container, contentEditable, listbox, options, and more via `slotsProps`
- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight implementation with no external dependencies
- **Fully Accessible**: Complete ARIA roles and keyboard support for optimal accessibility
- **Rich Text Support**: Display mentions as styled chips within the contentEditable interface
