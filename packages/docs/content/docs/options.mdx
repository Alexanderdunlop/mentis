description: How to structure and use the options prop for mentions.

import { MentisDemo } from "@/components";

The `options` prop is an array of objects that define the available mention targets. Each option must have a `label` (displayed in the modal) and a `value` (unique identifier).

### Example

```tsx
import { type MentionOption } from "mentis";

const options: MentionOption[] = [
  { label: "Alice", value: "alice" },
  { label: "Bob", value: "bob" },
  { label: "Charlie", value: "charlie" },
];
```

- **label**: The text shown in the mention dropdown.
- **value**: A unique string identifier for the option, or a function that will be called when the option is selected.

## Function Values

You can also use functions as values for options. When a function is provided as the `value`, it will be called when the option is selected instead of inserting the mention into the input:

```tsx
import { type MentionOption, MentionInput } from "mentis";

const options: MentionOption[] = [
  { label: "Alice", value: "alice" },
  { label: "Bob", value: "bob" },
  { label: "Charlie", value: "charlie" },
  {
    label: "Custom Action",
    value: () => {
      alert("Custom action executed!");
    },
  },
];

<MentionInput options={options} />;
```

<MentisDemo isFunctionOptionDemo />

In this example, selecting "Custom Action" will trigger the function instead of inserting a mention chip into the input. The trigger character and any text typed after it will be automatically removed from the input.
