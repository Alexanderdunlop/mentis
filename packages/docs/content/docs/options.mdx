description: How to structure and use the options prop for mentions.

The `options` prop is an array of objects that define the available mention targets. Each option must have a `label` (displayed in the modal) and a `value` (unique identifier).

### Example

```tsx
const options = [
  { label: "Alice", value: "alice" },
  { label: "Bob", value: "bob" },
  { label: "Charlie", value: "charlie" },
];
```

- **label**: The text shown in the mention dropdown.
- **value**: A unique string identifier for the option.
