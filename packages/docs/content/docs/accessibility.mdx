description: Accessibility features and ARIA support in MentionInput.
---

The `MentionInput` component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- Uses `role="combobox"` for the input and `role="listbox"`/`role="option"` for the dropdown and options.
- Supports keyboard navigation (see [Keyboard Navigation](./keyboard-navigation)).
- Uses `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-autocomplete`, `aria-haspopup`, and `aria-expanded` for screen reader support.
- Focus is managed when selecting options.
- The modal can be closed with `Escape` for easy dismissal.

These features ensure the component is usable by keyboard and assistive technology users.
