description: Accessibility features and ARIA support in MentionInput.
---

The `MentionInput` component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- Uses `role="combobox"` for the contentEditable element and `role="listbox"`/`role="option"` for the dropdown and options.
- Supports comprehensive keyboard navigation including arrow key navigation into mention chips (see [Keyboard Navigation](./keyboard-navigation)).
- Uses `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-autocomplete`, `aria-haspopup`, and `aria-expanded` for screen reader support.
- Focus is managed when selecting options and navigating with contentEditable.
- The modal can be closed with `Escape` for easy dismissal.
- ContentEditable implementation provides enhanced text manipulation and cursor positioning for screen readers.

These features ensure the component is usable by keyboard and assistive technology users, with the contentEditable architecture providing improved accessibility for rich text interactions.
