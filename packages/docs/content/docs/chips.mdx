# Mention Chips

Mention chips are the visual representation of selected mentions within the `MentionInput` component. They transform plain text mentions into styled, interactive elements that provide better visual feedback and user experience.

## What are Chips?

Chips are `<span>` elements with the class `mention-chip` that replace text-based mentions in the contentEditable interface. They serve several important purposes:

- **Visual Distinction**: Chips are styled differently from regular text to clearly indicate they represent mentions
- **Data Storage**: Each chip contains metadata about the mentioned entity via `data-*` attributes
- **Interactive Elements**: Chips can be navigated with keyboard and provide rich interaction
- **Content Protection**: Chips are set to `contentEditable="false"` to prevent accidental editing

## Chip Structure

When a mention is selected, it's converted into a chip with this structure:

```html
<span
  class="mention-chip"
  contenteditable="false"
  data-value="user123"
  data-label="John Doe"
>
  @John Doe
</span>
```

### Chip Attributes

| Attribute                 | Purpose                                              | Example        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `class="mention-chip"`    | Identifies the element as a mention chip             | `mention-chip` |
| `contenteditable="false"` | Prevents editing of the chip content                 | `false`        |
| `data-value`              | Stores the unique identifier of the mentioned entity | `user123`      |
| `data-label`              | Stores the display name of the mentioned entity      | `John Doe`     |

## Chip Creation

Chips are created in several scenarios:

### 1. Manual Selection

When a user selects an option from the dropdown, a chip is immediately created:

```tsx
<MentionInput
  options={[
    { label: "Alice", value: "alice" },
    { label: "Bob", value: "bob" },
  ]}
  trigger="@"
/>
```

### 2. Auto-Conversion

When `autoConvertMentions` is enabled, text mentions are automatically converted to chips when the user types a space or presses Enter:

```tsx
<MentionInput autoConvertMentions={true} options={options} trigger="@" />
```

### 3. Paste Operations

When pasting text containing mentions, the component automatically parses and converts them to chips:

```tsx
// Pasting "@Alice @Bob" will create chips for both mentions
```

## Chip Styling

Chips come with default styling:

```css
.mention-chip {
  display: inline-block;
  background: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 0px 4px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Customizing Chip Styles

You can customize the appearance of chips using the `chipClassName` property in `slotsProps`:

```tsx
<MentionInput options={options} chipClassName="mentis-demo-chip" />
```

```tsx
<MentionInput
  options={options}
  slotsProps={{
    chipClassName:
      "inline-flex items-center px-2 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium bg-blue-100 text-blue-800",
  }}
/>
```

This allows you to apply a custom CSS class to the chip elements.

For more advanced styling examples, see the [Styling & Customization](./styling) page.

## Chip Behavior

### Keyboard Navigation

Chips support full keyboard navigation:

- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate through chips and text
- **Backspace/Delete**: Remove chips when cursor is adjacent
- **Click**: Position cursor before or after the chip

### Chip Deletion on Input

When a user clicks inside a chip and starts typing, the chip is automatically deleted and replaced with the typed text. This provides an intuitive way to edit or remove mentions:

```tsx
// User clicks inside "@John Doe" chip and types "X"
// Result: "@John DoeX" (chip is deleted, "X" is not inserted)
```

This behavior ensures that:

- Users can easily modify or remove mentions by typing over them
- The component maintains data integrity by removing the mention from the data structure
- The `onChange` callback is triggered with updated mention data
- The text becomes fully editable after chip deletion

### Trigger Character Display

The `keepTriggerOnSelect` prop controls whether the trigger character is included in the chip:

```tsx
// With keepTriggerOnSelect: true (default)
<span class="mention-chip">@Alice</span>

// With keepTriggerOnSelect: false
<span class="mention-chip">Alice</span>
```

### Interactive Example

<MentisDemo />

Try the following interactions in the demo above:

1. **Create a chip**: Type `@` and select a user from the dropdown
2. **Delete by typing**: Click inside the chip and start typing - the chip will be deleted
3. **Edit mentions**: Click inside any chip and modify the text to see the chip deletion in action

Chips are a fundamental part of the MentionInput component that enhance user experience by providing clear visual feedback and maintaining data integrity for mentions within your application.
