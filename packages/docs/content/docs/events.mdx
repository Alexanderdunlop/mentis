## onChange

The `onChange` prop is a callback function that is called whenever the input value changes, either by typing or by selecting a mention option.

### Usage

```tsx
<MentionInput
  options={options}
  onChange={(value) => {
    // Handle the updated value
    console.log(value);
  }}
/>
```

- The callback receives the current input value as a string argument.
- It is called both when the user types and when a mention is inserted.
